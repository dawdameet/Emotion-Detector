# Emotion Prediction Model using Logistic Regression

This project is an emotion prediction model that classifies text into different emotional categories (such as happy, sad, excited, etc.). It uses a simple logistic regression classifier to analyze text and predict the associated emotion based on the content of the text.

## Project Overview

The model processes textual input and predicts the emotion behind the text. It is built using the `sklearn` library in Python and leverages the power of Logistic Regression to classify emotions. The dataset consists of labeled examples for different emotional states such as "happy", "sad", and "excited". 

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/emotion-prediction.git
cd emotion-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `model/` - Contains the trained model and logic for emotion prediction.
- `main.py` - The main script to run the model and make predictions.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/emotion-prediction.git
cd emotion-prediction
```

2. Run the `main.py` script to make a prediction based on input text:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will prompt for an input text, process it, and predict the corresponding emotion based on the trained model.

## Model Details

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - The input text is first tokenized and vectorized using the `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn`.
   - This converts the text into numerical features that can be processed by the machine learning model.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Logistic regression is used to classify the text into different emotional categories.
   - The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text with corresponding emotions.

3. **Prediction**:
   - After training, the model takes an input text, preprocesses it, and predicts the emotion with the highest probability.

## Example

```bash
Input Text: "I am so happy today!"
Predicted Emotion: Happy
```

## Next Steps

- Expand the model to predict more emotions.
- Implement a neural network model to improve accuracy.
- Use a more complex model like LSTM or BERT for emotion detection in texts.
- Implement a user interface to make predictions on real-time text input.
